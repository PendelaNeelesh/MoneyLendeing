# Lab_Project
To run the code:

  clone the repository or download the zip.
  
  Now go to frontend directory
  
    Run: npm install
    
    Run: npm start
    
    This starts a reactapp on port 3000
    
    The UI will be displayed but the backend requests will not be sent since server is not running
    
  Now go to backend directory
  
    Run: npm install
    
    Run: npm start
    
    This starts the server on port 8000
    
The website is ready on port 3000


Note: Since I built the react app and kept it in backend/client/ and configured index.js in backend/src just by running npm start in backend starts your site on port 8000.
